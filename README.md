# Project Description:
This website aims to provide personalized and real time information to the userâ€“like a daily feed or landing page. Registered users can input their preferences for location and interests, which is then used to showcase personalized stock information, weather, and news to the user. From the homepage, the user can then go to separate pages that contain more detailed information about the articles, stocks, or weather. The user will have access to their profile, where they can change their preferences.
